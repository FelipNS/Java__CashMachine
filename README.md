## Getting Started

First project to learn Java syntax. It's a simple program that simulates an ATM.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src/main`: the folder to maintain sources.
- `src/test`: the folder to maintain tests.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.
